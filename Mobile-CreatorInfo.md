Hi everyone,

If you are here, I want to say thank you for downloading my app!

1. Note that this is my first time publishing an app and so there many be bugs, irregular formatting, and annoying caveats I want to quick go over so this app is as smooth as possible for everyone!
2. Directions - Use the buttons included in the app to navigate between four different screens (Title, Set Lineups/Rosters, Baseball Game, Game Log). You will enter your own players into the lineup spots and use the strike/ball buttons to simulate a real baseball game!
3. This game has been designed for those who having pitching nets or even those who practice pitching and want to see how a real game might go if their pitch locations would occur.

Title Screen:
- Well if you got here, you mastered 1/2 of the title page! The other 1/2 is a button to send you to the set lineups screen.

Set Lineups/Rosters Screen:
* Use the text boxes to enter players of your choice! Note that most are hidden within scroll menus, so you will have to scroll through each of the four boxed-out sections to fill out each one.
** IF YOU PLAN ON USING RELIEVERS & BENCH, please be sure to fill out every single textbox! This to make sure you do not get any blank/null replacements or even crashes. Thank you and I plan to fix any problem users may have with this in the future.
*** PLEASE BE SURE THE TEAMS YOU USE EACH HAVE MORE THAN 3 CHARACTERS IN THEIR NAME! This is an issue I plan on correcting in the near future! If your team name is only one or two characters long, the program will crash!
- Once you have filled everything out, click the button to start the game!

Baseball Game Screen:
- Top - Scoreboard: Score, Inning (Top/Bot and #), Strikes/Balls/Outs (-1 of each you will notice as only those circles were ever used in my code)
- Middle - Buttons to change out pitchers and bench of each team included, and of course the strike zone!
    ***Strike zone: There are six buttons -- Top Strike, LS (Left Strike), MS (Middle Strike), RS (Right Strike), Bottom Strike, and Ball
        ****In order to get your game started, please click on one which corresponds to where you threw the ball to your pitching net!
            - You can of course go through and randomly click buttons to see the results, but the game is designed to work with a pitching                net! Of course, you do have to click the buttons (for right now :/)
- Middle/Bottom - The action bar! This will be the text block which tells you, the user, what occurs in your game!
- Bottom - This section tells you who is pitching and the amount of pitches they have thrown and who is at-bat, on-deck, and in-the-hole. The bottom-most button should be used to end the game when you desire.

Game Log Screen:
****** On this screen, you will see all the actions that happened in your game! You can enter extra notes at the top to be saved with your game log, but this is completely optional.
******* Click the button at the bottom to save. NOTE: You might need to give the app permission to save the game log. To do this, navigate to Settings >> Storage/Apps >> BaseballGameCreator >> Permissions >> Check the circle/box that says "Storage."
---------ON ANDROID: The files currently save to your Storage >> Documents or Downloads. To access your file upon saving, on your device, navigate to: Settings >> Storage >> Documents or Downloads -OR- My Files or Files >> Documents or Downloads
******** If the files do not show up right away upon closing the app or just saving the file, do not worry, they should appear within a day or two.

*CAVEATS AND CREATOR NOTES:*
--------------------------
This is the most important part of this doc for me, so please read this as well.

1. When you play your game, you will notice that upon getting three outs, you have to click a Strike/Ball button again to get to the next half or full inning. Sorry that it does not automatically switch innings on only one click, but it does not affect pitchcount! Also, when you click the buttons to change a player, it will not update automatically as you will have to click the strike/ball button for it to change.

2. Again, if you plan on using relievers and bench, please fill out EVERY SPOT! This is to ensure the app does not crash and that you do not get any blank-named players (I will fix this in the future if it is a bad problem).

3. Again, PLEASE BE SURE THE TEAMS YOU USE EACH HAVE MORE THAN 3 CHARACTERS IN THEIR NAME! This is an issue I plan on correcting in the near future! If your team name is only one or two characters long, the program will crash!

4. Be sure to give the app permission to save your game log (if you desire). Check out the third point I make in the section I have titled "Game Log Screen" up above on how to do so.

5. Future Ideas: Users can import lineups using a .txt file, you can choose who to replace who, and to make a real product which omits the user from having to click the strike/ball buttons (hitting something would automatically do it).
